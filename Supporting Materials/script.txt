🎙️ Final 5-Minute DV Project Presentation Script
👋 0:00–0:15 – Introduction
Good [morning/afternoon], everyone.
We are a team of three: Swapnil, Vivek, and Chinmay, and today we’re excited to present our Data Visualization project that uncovers powerful business insights from a multi-dimensional retail dataset.

⏱️ 0:15–0:45 – Preprocessing in Orange
We began our work with data preprocessing in Orange 3.
Using multiple sheets like sales orders, customers, inventory, returns, and more, we filtered the necessary rows using the Select Rows widget.
Then, we saved the cleaned datasets with the Save Data widget.
This step was critical to ensure that the data sent to Tableau was clean, consistent, and relevant for analysis.

⏱️ 0:45–4:00 – 10 Key Grains & Insights
From over 25 grains, we focused on these 10 impactful visualizations:

1️⃣ Profit Heatmap (SKU × Region × Time × Category)
Highlights top-performing SKUs by geography and time, aiding targeted stocking.

2️⃣ Customer Segmentation Matrix
Clusters customers by channel, loyalty, and purchase behavior, helping in marketing strategy.

3️⃣ Inventory Movement Funnel
Tracks how products move from supplier to shelf, flagging inefficiencies.

4️⃣ Return Analysis Breakdown
Identifies high-return products and reasons—helpful for quality control.

5️⃣ Purchase Order Efficiency
Measures supplier performance through lead time and order volume.

6️⃣ Monthly Sales by Branch & Payment Method (H1 2023)
Reveals seasonal and regional trends by payment type.

7️⃣ Category vs Loyalty-wise Gross Profit
Shows how loyal customers contribute differently across product categories.

8️⃣ Top 10 Loyal Customers by Gross Profit
Identifies VIP customers for reward programs and retention efforts.

9️⃣ Monthly Return % by SubCategory
Reveals subcategories with seasonal or persistently high return rates.

🔟 Profit by Discount Range
Uncovers the profitability sweet spot across various discount bands.

⏱️ 4:00–5:30 – Dashboards & Storyboard
We built 6 insightful dashboards, stitched together in a storyboard that simulates real-world business flow:

📊 1. Profit Pulse
(Grains 1 & 25) – How profit varies by SKU and discount level.

👥 2. Customer Insight Hub
(Grains 2, 7, 15) – Understand and prioritize your most valuable customers.

📦 3. Inventory & Supply Chain Monitor
(Grains 3 & 5) – Track supplier efficiency and stock flow.

🔁 4. Returns Analyzer
(Grains 4, 16, 17) – Dissect returns by reason, region, and loyalty.

🛍️ 5. Sales Snapshot
(Grains 7 & 19) – Monitor monthly trends and branch-level sales.

🌍 6. Country-wise Profitability View
(Grains 6 & 22) – Compare metrics like revenue, discount, and cost across countries.

🧭 Storyline Flow:
Starts with profitability, dives into customer behavior, flows through inventory and returns, and ends with a regional profitability snapshot—mimicking a C-level decision path.

⏱️ 5:30–6:00 – OLAP Pie Chart Analysis
In addition to Tableau, we used OLAP in Excel to break down sales by product type.

Here’s a pie chart showing the sales contribution of clothing items:



Jacket, Pants, Shirt: ~23% each

Dress: 21%

Jeans: 10%

This gives us a quick view of high-performing categories and helps in category-level planning.
